      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is a widely-used package manager
      for JavaScript that helps developers install, share, and manage code
      dependencies for Node.js projects.

      However, it is not recommended to use npm; instead, we suggest using pnpm
      for better performance and efficiency. With the addition of Corepack, npm
      is no longer the default Node package manager.
