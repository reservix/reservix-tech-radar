      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is a widely-used package manager
      for JavaScript that helps developers install, share, and manage code
      dependencies for Node.js projects.

      However, it is not recommended to use npm; instead, we suggest using pnpm
      for better performance and efficiency. With the addition of Corepack, npm
      is no longer the default Node package manager.

    description: >
      <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> is a powerful module
      bundler for JavaScript applications that enables developers to bundle and
      optimize assets such as JavaScript, CSS, and images.

      It is not recommended to use Webpack for new projects; instead, more
      modern bundlers like vite or tsup, which require less configuration and
      setup, are preferred. If you need to migrate away from Webpack or start a
      new project, please contact your area architect for support and guidance.

      designed specifically for building TypeScript libraries, offering a
      streamlined setup with minimal configuration.

      While tsup is recommended for library development in TypeScript, Vite is
      preferred for building applications due to its superior development
      experience and performance.

    description: >
      <a href="https://behat.org/">Behat</a> is a PHP testing framework which
      can be used to automate acceptance tests in a human readable language
      called Gherkin. Since it is based on Cucumber, it also helps teams to
      adopt and implement Behavioral Driven Development (BDD).

      While Behat is still a good solution, other frameworks like Cypress are
      more feature rich and developer friendly. We recommend to use an
      alternative like Cypress for new projects.
