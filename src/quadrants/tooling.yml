      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is a widely-used package manager
      for JavaScript that helps developers install, share, and manage code
      dependencies for Node.js projects.

      However, it is not recommended to use npm; instead, we suggest using pnpm
      for better performance and efficiency. With the addition of Corepack, npm
      is no longer the default Node package manager.

      can be used to automate acceptance tests in a human readable language
      called Gherkin. Since it is based on Cucumber, it also helps teams to
      adopt and implement Behavioral Driven Development (BDD).

      While Behat is still a good solution, other frameworks like Cypress are
      more feature rich and developer friendly. We recommend to use an
      alternative like Cypress for new projects.
