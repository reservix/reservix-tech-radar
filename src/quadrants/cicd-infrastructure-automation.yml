      <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is an open source
      containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications
      into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application
      source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies
      required to run that code in any environment.

      Development teams love Docker, as the Docker image format makes it easier
      to achieve parity between development and production, making for reliable
      deployments. It is a natural fit in a microservices-style application as a
      packaging mechanism for self-contained services. On the operational front,
      Docker support in monitoring tools (Sensu, Prometheus, cAdvisor, etc.),
      orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Marathon, etc.) and deployment-automation
      tools reflect the growing maturity of the platform and its readiness for
      production use.

      <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI/CD</a> is a tool for
      software development using the continuous methodologies: Continuous
      Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
      It helps to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle and
      ensures that all the code deployed to production complies with the code
      standards you established for your app. GitLab CI/CD can automatically
      build, test, deploy, and monitor your applications.

      Since we are using GitLab as to develop and manage our software, using its
      integrated CI/CD tools is our preferred way to make sure our projects are
      healthy and meet our quality standards.

    description: >
      <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> are a way
      to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows right
      in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and
      share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine
      actions in a completely customized workflow.

      Projects, especially the open source ones, that are hosted on GitHub
      should make use of Github Actions to ensure that the projects meet our
      quality standards.

  - label: Kibana
    description: >
      When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as
      microservices, DevOps and QA in production, development teams need
      increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk
      usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams
      collect application and business-specific metrics using tools. <a
      href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> is a tools that can help
      with gathering this data and boos observability.

      We use Kibana extensively to ensure our applications run smoothly even
      under high-load scenarios. Kibana helps us to find issues with our system
      fast and react accordingly. Based on its strengths, Kibana has become our
      default choice for observing our production environments.

      With <a href=" https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, you can manage
      cloud infrastructure by writing declarative definitions. The configuration
      of the servers instantiated by Terraform is usually left to tools like
      Puppet, Chef or Ansible.

    description: >
      <a href="SonarQube">SonarQube</a> is a open-source platform for the
      continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews with
      static analysis of code which can detect bugs, code smells in many
      programming languages.

      We infrequently set it up for projects but are not sure about the
      additional value we get from the analysis. We need more teams actively
      using it to make a decision.

      <a href="https://www.chromatic.com/">Chromatic</a> is a cloud-based tool
      for visual regression tests, based on <a
      href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>. It streamlines the process
      of shipping UI components with higher quality by providing a shared
      workspace for teams to comment and review UI work together.

      We started using Chromatic for reviewing work on our design system in the
      hope that we more confidently can manage the different themes withour
      accidental breaking things. So far it looks very promising and an
      improvement to our previous workflow.
