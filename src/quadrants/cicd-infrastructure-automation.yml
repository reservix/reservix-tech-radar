  - label: Open Telemetry
    description: >
      <a href="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source
      framework that standardizes the collection and correlation of metrics,
      logs, and traces across distributed systems, enabling better observability
      and performance monitoring.

      OpenTelemetry is currently in a trial phase as we assess its capability to
      streamline our monitoring and diagnostics. Its potential to provide a
      unified view of system performance makes it a promising tool for our
      observability needs.

      Teams interested in exploring its benefits are encouraged to reach out to
      Team ArCo for further information and trial participation.

      <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org">Web Components</a> are a set of
      standardized web platform APIs that enable developers to create
      encapsulated, reusable custom HTML elements, fostering modularity and
      maintainability in web development.

      The adoption of Web Components is currently on hold as we reassess their
      integration within our ecosystem. Due to compatibility and integration
      concerns with our existing frameworks, teams are advised not to use them
      at this time.
