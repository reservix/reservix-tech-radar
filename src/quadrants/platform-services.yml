      <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is an open-source relational
      database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of
      co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the acronym for
      Structured Query Language.

      Teams may adopt PostgreSQL as a robust, open-source relational database
      solution. Its strong ACID compliance, extensibility, and active community
      support make it an excellent choice for building secure and scalable
      applications.

      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> also known as
      Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system
      emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

      In our software products PostgreSQL is kind of new, even though it is
      already a solid component of our software landscape.
  - label: Elasticsearch
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a> is an open source
      search platform. It is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally
      scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data
      structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API. It
      provides an elegant model of operation with automatic discovery of peers
      in a cluster, failover, and replication. Elastic Search can be extended
      with a plugin system that allows adding new functionality and changing
      existing behavior. The community around this tool is quite vibrant as
      illustrated by the number of client libraries available in languages like
      Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.

      Elasticsearch is currently on hold as we evaluate open-source alternatives
      like OpenSearch due to recent licensing changes. While Elasticsearch
      continues to serve as our solution for observability (see Kibana) and
      search in existing products, we are assessing whether it remains the best
      fit for our long-term strategy and exploring migration paths to
      open-source alternatives.

    description: >
      For problems that fit the document database model, <a

      choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation,
      the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of
      problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a
      document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the
      inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven
      itself on many projects.

    description: >
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is a serverless
      compute service that runs your code in response to events and
      automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. These
      events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing
      an item in a shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

      For stateless services, this means you donâ€™t need to worry about running
      any long-lived machines, potentially reducing costs and improving
      security. Despite other forays into the PaaS space by AWS, Lambda looks
      the closest to getting this right.

      Our teams continue to enjoy using AWS Lambda and are beginning to use it
      for serverless architectures which are built for the future.

      ensures smooth communication between distributed components by managing
      message delivery efficiently.

      SQS also supports various use cases, including event-driven architecture,
      load leveling, and background task processing, making it an integral part

      SNS is particularly useful for event notifications, system alerts, and
      cross-application messaging, allowing us to build highly responsive and

      When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as

      increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk
      usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams
      collect application and business-specific metrics using tools. <a

      with gathering this data and boos observability.

      We use Kibana extensively for our observability needs. It ensures that our
      applications run smoothly even under high-load scenarios. Kibana helps us
      to find issues with our system fast and react accordingly. Based on its
