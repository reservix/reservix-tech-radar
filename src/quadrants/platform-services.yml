    description: >
      <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a> is an open source
      search platform. It is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally
      scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data
      structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API. It
      provides an elegant model of operation with automatic discovery of peers
      in a cluster, failover, and replication. Elastic Search can be extended
      with a plugin system that allows adding new functionality and changing
      existing behavior. The community around this tool is quite vibrant as
      illustrated by the number of client libraries available in languages like
      Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.

    description: >
      <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is an open source, in-memory data
      structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming
      engine. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists,
      sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial
      indexes, and streams.

       Redis has proven a useful tool on multiple projects as structured cache.

    description: >
      For problems that fit the document database model, <a
      href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is now the most popular
      choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation,
      the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of
      problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a
      document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the
      inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven
      itself on many projects.

    description: >
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is a serverless
      compute service that runs your code in response to events and
      automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. These
      events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing
      an item in a shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

      For stateless services, this means you donâ€™t need to worry about running
      any long-lived machines, potentially reducing costs and improving
      security. Despite other forays into the PaaS space by AWS, Lambda looks
      the closest to getting this right.

      Our teams continue to enjoy using AWS Lambda and are beginning to use it
      to experiment with Serverless architectures.

      The Serverless Framework is an open-source tool that simplifies the
      deployment and management of serverless applications, allowing developers
      to build and run applications without managing infrastructure.

      We are currently evaluating the Serverless Framework due to changes in
      their pricing model in version 4, and we are uncertain if it remains
      sustainable for our use case moving forward.

      The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/cdk/">AWS Cloud Development Kit
      (CDK)</a> is an open-source framework that enables developers to define
      cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages.

      It is currently being evaluated as an alternative to the Serverless
      Framework, offering more flexibility and potential alignment with our
      infrastructure needs.

    description: >
      When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as
      microservices, DevOps and QA in production, development teams need
      increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk
      usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams
      collect application and business-specific metrics using tools. <a
      href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> is a tools that can help
      with gathering this data and boos observability.

      We use Kibana extensively to ensure our applications run smoothly even
      under high-load scenarios. Kibana helps us to find issues with our system
      fast and react accordingly. Based on its strengths, Kibana has become our
      default choice for observing our production environments.

      <a href=" https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is an open-source
      infrastructure as code tool that allows developers to define and provision
      data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It
      enables consistent and repeatable deployment of cloud and on-premises
      resources, simplifying infrastructure management across multiple
      environments.

      Terraform is widely used to power and manage our infrastructure, ensuring
      consistent and scalable deployment.
