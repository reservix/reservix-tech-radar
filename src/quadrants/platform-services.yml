      <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> is an open-source relational
      database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of
      co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the acronym for
      Structured Query Language.

      Teams may adopt PostgreSQL as a robust, open-source relational database
      solution. Its strong ACID compliance, extensibility, and active community
      support make it an excellent choice for building secure and scalable
      applications.

      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> also known as
      Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system
      emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

      In our software products PostgreSQL is kind of new, even though it is
      already a solid component of our software landscape.
  - label: Elasticsearch
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a> is an open source
      search platform. It is an extensible, multi-tenanted, and horizontally
      scalable search solution based on Apache Lucene. It allows complex data
      structures to be indexed and retrieved through a JSON based REST API. It
      provides an elegant model of operation with automatic discovery of peers
      in a cluster, failover, and replication. Elastic Search can be extended
      with a plugin system that allows adding new functionality and changing
      existing behavior. The community around this tool is quite vibrant as
      illustrated by the number of client libraries available in languages like
      Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.

      In our software products, we utilize Elasticsearch as a search cluster for
      end users. In other cases, we still maintain custom solutions that  may
      eventually be migrated to Elasticsearch.

      Elasticsearch also serves as our primary solution for observability, see
      Kibana for a detailed description.

    description: >
      For problems that fit the document database model, <a
      href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is now the most popular
      choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation,
      the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of
      problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a
      document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the
      inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven
      itself on many projects.

    description: >
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is a serverless
      compute service that runs your code in response to events and
      automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. These
      events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing
      an item in a shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

      For stateless services, this means you donâ€™t need to worry about running
      any long-lived machines, potentially reducing costs and improving
      security. Despite other forays into the PaaS space by AWS, Lambda looks
      the closest to getting this right.

      Our teams continue to enjoy using AWS Lambda and are beginning to use it
      for serverless architectures which are built for the future.

      In our systems, we leverage Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) as a
      reliable message queuing service to decouple and scale microservices.  It
      ensures smooth communication between distributed components by managing
      message delivery efficiently.

      SQS also supports various use cases, including event-driven architecture,
      load leveling, and background task processing, making it an integral part
      of our asynchronous workflows.

      In our systems, we utilize Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) as a
      scalable and reliable messaging service for pub/sub (publish/subscribe)
      communication. It enables the dissemination of messages to multiple
      subscribers, ensuring real-time updates across distributed systems.

      SNS is particularly useful for event notifications, system alerts, and
      cross-application messaging, allowing us to build highly responsive and
      decoupled architectures.

      Here's an improved version of that text:

      We are currently evaluating the changes in version 4, specifically
      regarding  the updated pricing model. Due to these adjustments, we believe
      it may no  longer be a sustainable option for our use case. As an
      alternative, we are  exploring CDK to see if it better aligns with our
      needs.

    description: >
      When combining modern techniques and architecture styles, such as
      microservices, DevOps and QA in production, development teams need
      increasingly sophisticated monitoring. Simply looking a graphs of disk
      usage and CPU utilization is not sufficient anymore, and many teams
      collect application and business-specific metrics using tools. <a
      href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana/">Kibana</a> is a tools that can help
      with gathering this data and boos observability.

      We use Kibana extensively for our observability needs. It ensures that our
      applications run smoothly even under high-load scenarios. Kibana helps us
      to find issues with our system fast and react accordingly. Based on its
      strengths, Kibana has become our default choice for observing our
      production environments.
