      `For problems that fit the document database model, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is now the most popular choice. In addition to ease of use and a solid technical implementation, the community and ecosystem contributed to this success. We are aware of problems where teams were tempted by the popularity of MongoDB when a document database was not a good fit or they did not understand the inherent complexity. When used appropriately, however, MongoDB has proven itself on many projects.`,

That said, we've concerns about misuse of this framework and some of the problems that can occur. Examples include performance gotchas around N+1 queries and lots of boilerplate code needed when adding new models, leading to complexity. There are workarounds to these gotchas such as query caching.`,

Moreover, this enables you to use many third-party APIs as well, by just simply seeing their sample data responses, and the best part is you probably donâ€™t have to manage any of these third-party APIs.`,

One remarkable benefit is that this integration style uses asynchronous communication, i.e. the temporal decoupling of sender and receiver. At Reservix, we have started to establish an event-driven architecture as our preferred way of system integration`,
