  - label: PHP
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is popular general-purpose
      scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It is
      widely used and our developers are very proficient solving business
      problems with PHP.

    description: >
      The <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> PHP framework is a
      well-organized, feature-rich PHP framework whose architecture paves the
      way for developers to build sustainable web applications in the easiest
      way possible which further enhances the users' experience.

      It is widely used in our organization and our developers have a lot of
      experience solving business problems with it.

  - label: TypeScript
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, a statically
      typed language and superset of JavaScript, has become our sensible
      default. Large-scale projects benefit most from the type safety.
      TypeScritp requires minimal configuration management, has well-integrated
      IDE support and its ability to refactor code safely and gradually adopt
      types. The support from tooling and libraries is excellent.

  - label: JavaScript
    description: >
      <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript
      (JS)</a> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
      programming language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a
      dynamically typed language, which means that types are checked, and data
      type errors are only detected at runtime, which leads to errors only show
      during production.

      JavaScript is only suited for small-scale applications. TypeScript should
      be favored over JavaScript. TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to
      refactor. This enables developers to evade errors and do rewrites much
      easier.

  - label: React
    description: >
      In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, <a
      href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a> stands out due to its design
      around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly
      simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly
      plague applications written with other frameworks. We're seeing the
      benefits of React.js on a growing number of projects, large and small,
      while at the same time we continue to be concerned about the state and the
      future of other popular frameworks like AngularJS. This has led to
      React.js becoming our default choice for JavaScript frameworks.

  - label: Vue
    description: >
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> has become one of the successfully
      applied, loved and trusted frontend JavaScript frameworks among our
      community. Although there are other, well-adopted alternatives, such as
      React.js, the simplicity of Vue.js in API design, its clear segregation of
      directives and components (one file per component idiom) and its simpler
      state management have made it a compelling option among others.

    description: >
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a> is a
      modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables
      developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run
      in .NET.

  - label: Java
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a> is an object-oriented programming
      language that produces software for multiple platforms. A compiled Java
      application runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux
      and Mac OS. It is one of the most popular programming languages (according
      to TIOBE's index).

      Some teams started to use Java as their preferred language instead of PHP,
      since it is much better suited for their working enviroment and problem
      they are trying to solve.

  - label: Zend
    description: >
      <a href="https://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> is a collection
      of professional PHP packages. It can be used to develop web applications
      and services using PHP 5.6+, and provides 100% object-oriented code using
      a broad spectrum of language features.

      Our teams switched or are using Symfony to build our applications and thus
      the later should be preferred for projects.

  - label: Marigold
    description: >
      <a href="https://marigold-ui.io/">Marigold</a> is a React implementation
      of Reservix' design language. It aims to provides a robust and modular
      foundation for building digital products that are accessible and adaptive
      across screen sizes while delivering a consistent, delightful experience
      for all users.

      React-based projects should evalute the usage of Marigold since it will
      remove a lot of the work necessary to building user interfaces that adhere
      our design standards and accessibilty guidelines. It will make it easier
      to update the application when design changes happen.

  - label: Next.js
    description: >
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is an opinionated,
      zero-configuration framework that includes simplified routing, automatic
      compilation and bundling with Webpack and Babel, fast hot reloading for a
      convenient developer workflow among other features. It provides
      server-side rendering by default, improves search engine optimization and
      the initial load time and supports incremental static generation.

      We've had positive experience reports from teams using Next.js and, given
      its large community, continue to be excited about the evolution of the
      framework.

  - label: Express
    description: >
      <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> is a back end web application
      framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the
      MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs and has
      been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js in the
      past.

      The developer experience of Express feels dated. Todays standard tooling
      and patterns, like async/await, need to be stack ontop of Express. There
      is no good support for TypeScript. And worst of it all, Epxress is not
      actively maintained. An attempt to realse a new major version was started
      over 7 years ago.

      Thus we highly recommend new projects to use alternatives, like Fastify.

  - label: Fastify
    description: >
      <a href="https://www.fastify.io/">Fastify</a> is inspired by Hapi and
      Express and provides a faster alternative to Express with less overhead.
      It is built as a general-purpose web framework, but it shines when it
      comes to its fast HTTP APIs. It offers ease in handling request-response
      validations, support for TypeScript and a plugin ecosystem giving  teams
      an easier experience developing software.

      Unlike Express, Fastify's core is implemented with asynchronous code,
      which not only leads to a better developer experience but also to less
      memory leaks, a problem often times associated with Express. Besides that
      Fastify comes with a much better performance than Express. Thus we
      recommend to assess Fastify for new projects.
