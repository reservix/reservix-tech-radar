Instead of reproducing the issue in headless mode,\n      developers can watch the testing video in order to fix it.\n\n      We started using Cypress in some projects instead of Behat and the first\n      results look very promising.\n    ring: assess\n    active: true\n    moved: 0\n  - label: Behat\n    description: >\n      <a href=\"https://behat.org/\">Behat</a> is a PHP testing framework which\n      can be used to automate acceptance tests in a human readable language\n      called Gherkin.
