We use four rings with the following semantics: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Adopt:</strong> Technologies that we have high confidence in to serve our purpose and help us to succeed. We are familiar with these technologies and use them in production. </li> <li> <strong>Trial:</strong> Technologies that we have seen work with success in a project or product. We actively evaluate the potential of the technology and share knowledge and experiences. </li> <li> <strong>Assess:</strong> Technologies that have a clear benefit for us and thus might become relevant soon. We might establish these technologies as one of our preferred ways to build production applications. </li> <li> <strong>On Hold:</strong> Technologies that are not recommended to be used for new projects and products. Continued usage in existing applications is usually fine, but it might necessary to migrate to active alternatives. </li> </ul> </div>  <div> <h2>What is the purpose?</h2> <p> The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Reservix to pick the best technologies for new projects and products; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development — changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects. </p> <h2>How do we maintain it?</h2> <p> The Tech Radar is maintained by <em>Team Arco</em> — who facilitate and drive the technology selection discussions at Reservix across the Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all Engineering teams at Reservix and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br> </p> <p> <em>The Tech Radar is based on Zalando's excellent <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">Tech Radar tooling</a></em> </p> </div> </div> </body></html>
